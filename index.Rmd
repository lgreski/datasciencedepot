Data Science Depot is a collection of data science articles I've written as part of my participation in the Data Science Community on Coursera.org, interactions on Twitter @[lgreski](https://twitter.com/lgreski), and content I've posted on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8471931/len-greski) . I also post references to articles of interest, or content that I've used as supporting material for answers I've provided to students in my role as a Community Mentor in the [Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization](http://bit.ly/2czgkI7).
